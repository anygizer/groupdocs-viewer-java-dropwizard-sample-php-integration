GroupDocs.Viewer for Java integration with PHP -- Java part
===========================================================

This code is based on the GroupDocs.Viewer for Java library Dropwizard sample and modified to support integration with the PHP application.

> Note: This slightly modified original Dropwizard sample is only one part of the integration.

A complete guide with descriptions and other code parts is provided in the [GroupDocs documentation wiki](http://groupdocs.com/docs/display/viewerjava/How+to+Integrate+the+GroupDocs.Viewer+for+Java+Library+into+Your+PHP+Web+App).
